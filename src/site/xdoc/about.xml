                TwoStore is designed for repositories that have outgrown the default storage configuration that is shipped with Fedora, but which do not yet require the extensive machinery of gridded or cloud-based storage.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's based on a simple Adler32-based hash and TwoStore, a special Akubra BlobStore that acts as a binary switch between two other BlobStores. TwoStores are used to assemble other BlobStores into a manually-balanced binary tree of stores.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the attractive qualities of TwoStore implementations is that growth in the tree of stores causes more of the hash to be consumed to traverse that same in-memory tree, and not consumed inside a persisting store, where seeking operations are typically much more expensive.
